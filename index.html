            <div class = "Paragraph"> I am a junior studying Computer Systems Engineering and Computer Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
                Since I was four or five I have been interested in the engineering field. 
                Since then, my interests have matured from steam locomotives to analog and digital circuit design... 
                I have to go to class now and will finish this later!

            Charged Particle Simulator
        </div>
        <div class = "Paragraph" > 
            While taking Physics II, I realized all of the simulators my school used
            were created and hosted by other colleges. I felt and still feel that RPI, being a 
            technical institution, should have it's own suite of simulators available for students and the general public.
            This was the motivation behind working on this project, with the long-run goal
            being gifting the simulator to the RPI physics department.

            Circuit Simulator
        </div>
        <div class = "Paragraph" > 
            In RPI's Circuits class, students are tasked with solving basic circuits over and over again.
            Quickly, I became frustrated with the number of circuits we had to solve and how similar each circuit was.
            To aid in checking my homework and practice problems, I decided to create my own basic circuit simulator.
            I worked on this project in my free time for a few weeks, and am satisfied with the functionality of the project at this point.
            In the future I plan to add more components and improve the functionality of the program.

            CAD Program
        </div>
        <div class = "Paragraph" > 
            I recently transitioned to from using Windows 10 to Ubuntu. I have enjoyed linux so far, although I ran into an issue: I couldn't find a 
            decent 3d CAD modeler. There are a few free programs available for linux, although I did not like how the programs functioned. This prompted me to
            research how 3d graphics are rendered, and more specifically how I could render 3d objects within a webpage. As of writing, I have a program 
            capable of rendering sketches, bodies, text, planes, etc. all in webGL. WASD and the arrow keys allow for me to manuever this 3d environment, 
            with a few mouse gestures programmed to adjust settings like zoom and FOV. This is likely the most mathematically complex project I've tackled,
            with constraints currently being the bane of my existence.
            I plan to add basic CAD modeling functionality like the ability to constrain
            sketches and turn 2d sketches into 3d objects through extrudes, revolves, and more.
