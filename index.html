            Hello and welcome to my website! This is a webpage I am working on to learn more about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and websites as a whole.

            About me: I am (almost) a junior studying Computer Systems Engineering and Computer Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
            Since I was four or five I have been interested in the engineering field. 
            Since then, my interests have matured from steam locomotives to analog and digital circuit design... I have to go to class now and will finish this later :-(

            Dev Note:
            To be honest, I don't really know what I'm doing. 
            I have spent waaaaaayyyy too much time messing around with colors when I should be studying for physics II. 
            I have a test on Wednesday... and it's Tuesday...
