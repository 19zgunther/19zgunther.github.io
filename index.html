                While taking Physics II, I realized all of the simulators my school used were created and hosted by other colleges. 
                I felt and still feel that RPI, being a technical institution, should have it's own suite of simulators available to students and the general public. 
                This was the motivation behind working on this project, with the long-run goal being gifting the simulator to the RPI physics department.

                In RPI's Circuits class, students are tasked with solving basic circuits over and over again. Quickly, I became frustrated with the number of circuits 
                we had to solve and how similar each circuit was. To aid in checking my homework and practice problems, I decided to create my own basic circuit simulator. 
                I worked on this project in my free time for a few weeks, and am satisfied with the functionality of the project at this point. In the future I plan to 
                add more electrical components and improve the speed of the program.

                Among my friends, the phrase 'ray tracing' is commonly thrown around when we talk about high performance graphics for games or simulations.
                I never fully understood what raytracing was and how it works until I began this project. Raytracing is a 
                graphics rendering method which can produce realistic lighting by tracing the path of light from lightsources to the camera.
                In reality the reverse path is found by firing rays out of a camera and seeing what objects they hit, this way all possible photon
                paths from the light sources which do not enter the camera do not have to be computed.

                As I have been building this website I commonly come across little project and web dev ideas I would like to work on.
                Sometimes they are large enough projects to deserve an entire page and description, but more often then not they are 
                little gizmos and only take an hour or so to code. This page is where all of the little projects end up, and is a 
                scratch pad for me to experiment with!

                I have always been interested in procedurally generated terrain and objects. 
                The idea that I can generate different 3d objects by simply modifying a few input parameters prompted me to build this model.
                In this project I learned about generating different 3d models, and randomly augmenting those models to produce familiar-looking 
                objects. In the end algorithms to generate earth-like planets, astroids, satellites, and space stations were implemented.
