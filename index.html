            </div>
            <div class = "Paragraph"> I am a junior studying Computer Systems Engineering and Computer Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
                Since I was four or five I have been interested in the engineering field. 
                Since then, my interests have matured from steam locomotives to analog and digital circuit design... 
                I have to go to class now and will finish this later!

            Charged Particle Simulator
        </div>
        <div class = "Paragraph" > 
            While taking Physics II, I realized all of the simulators my school used
            were created and hosted by other colleges. I felt and still feel that RPI, being a 
            technical institution, should have it's own suite of simulators available for students and the general public.
            This was the motivation behind working on this project, with the long-run goal
            being gifting the simulator to the RPI physics department.

            Circuit Simulator
        </div>
        <div class = "Paragraph" > 
            In RPI's Circuits class, students are tasked with solving basic circuits over and over again.
            Quickly, I became frustrated with the number of circuits we had to solve and how similar each circuit was.
            To aid in checking my homework and practice problems, I decided to create my own basic circuit simulator.
            I worked on this project in my free time for a few weeks, and am satisfied with the functionality of the project at this point.
            In the future I plan to add more components and improve the functionality of the program.
