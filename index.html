                </div>
                <div class = "Paragraph"> I am (almost) a junior studying Computer Systems Engineering and Computer Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
                    Since I was four or five I have been interested in the engineering field. 
                    Since then, my interests have matured from steam locomotives to analog and digital circuit design... I have to go to class now and will finish this later :-(

                    While taking Physics II, I realized all of the simulators my school used
                    were created and hosted by other colleges. I felt and still feel that RPI, being a 
                    technical institution, should have it's own suite of simulators available for students and the general public.
                    This was the motivation behind working on this project, with the long-run goal
                    being gifting the simulator to the RPI physics department.
