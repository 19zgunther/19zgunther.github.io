            </div>
            <div class = "Paragraph"> I am (almost) a junior studying Computer Systems Engineering and Computer Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
                Since I was four or five I have been interested in the engineering field. 
                Since then, my interests have matured from steam locomotives to analog and digital circuit design... I have to go to class now and will finish this later :-(

            Charged Particle Simulator
        </div>
        <div class = "Paragraph" > 
            While taking Physics II, I realized all of the simulators my school used
            were created and hosted by other colleges. I felt and still feel that RPI, being a 
            technical institution, should have it's own suite of simulators available for students and the general public.
            This was the motivation behind working on this project, with the long-run goal
            being gifting the simulator to the RPI physics department.
