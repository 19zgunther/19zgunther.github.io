            About:
        </div>
        One day I was wandering aimlessly around the internet and found an image of reflective spheres and a few other basic objects. After a quick search, I discovered
        the image was generated using ray tracing, a rendering technique I had heard of but knew nothing about. After a few hours of research and programming
        I created this: The world's most innefficient single threaded ray tracing renderer!
        <br><br>
        This renderer (currently) can render two basic objects: Spheres and planes. It works by projecting a ray for each pixel and seeing what the ray intersects with. If the ray intersects with
        an object the object color is recorded, a ray from that intersection is shot to the point light source to determine the light level (based on distance and blocking objects), and finally a 
        new ray is recursively shot from the intersection in the reflected direction. The reflected ray returns a color value from what it hit, and all of the colors and light levels are accumulated
        to find the final pixel color to display on the screen.
        <br><br>
        Obviously this implementation has some shortcomings. Firstly, this program sequentially computes each pixel even though each could be computed independently. 
        For a 500 by 500 pixel rendering with 7 objects, this program takes a painfully long time to render. On my computer it takes a full second, although
        results may vary depending on which processor used. I have plans to use webGL and fragment shaders to parallelize this rendering technique to decrease rendering time, 
        although this would require a complete restart to do so, and I do not currently have the time.
        <br>
        Secondly, only two types of objects are currently renderable (Spheres and Planes) and no other light sources besides point light sources have been implemented.
        This means only hard shadows are renderable, and light source reflections are... less than optimal. Currently the point light source appears to be a rather large sphere,
        but only the very center is used for computing shadows whereas the rest is simply a white-colored object.
